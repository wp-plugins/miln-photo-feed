Publish your photos as a photo feed. Suitable for iPhoto, Google Reader, and RSS readers.

== Description ==

Miln Photo Feed creates a photo feed using local photos attached to your posts. The feed contains one item per photo; each item includes the photo as both an inline src image and as a linked enclosure.

This plug-in is ideal for sharing photos with family and friends who prefer to see images in iPhoto or through a RSS client, such as Google Reader.

Photos attached but not visible within a post are included within the Miln Photo Feed. This lets you create a post highlighting a few photos, while also offering a photo feed containing many more photos.

== Installation ==

Miln Photo Feed is a standard WordPress plug-in. The plug-in can be installed through your WordPress dashboard:

1. Log into WordPress.
